3. Edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, thus adequate time management.

****Results****:
1. Successfully gained insights required.
2. uploadation amd storage of files and documents.
3. Knowledge earned with each steps.

**Challenges and Learnings:**
1. Lack of correlation among few entites and features.
2. Learnt importance of naming conventions.
3. Learnt how imperitive is to have proper management
